## Essentials of Project Management

### Q: Why project management?  

Let's suppose you are happily working away, feeling great writing some software, adding features, etc.  You've got a great team, working on something cool.  

You find our your competition has just released their software, and it looks a lot like what you've been working on.  It may not be finished yet, but you can't tell quite, and they're first to market.  
Your team had a timeline of three months, now the managers want a prototype today or yesterday, and something definite by the end of the week, otherwise you'll lose customers.  

__Q: What do you do?__
+ Panic.
+ Take a quick look at your competitors.  It's not as bad as you think, but hard to convince others.
+ Go to Defcon 2.
+ Grumble to your coworkers.
+ Watch managers throw a temper tantrum.  Throw a temper tantrum yourself.
+ Blame others.  Blame yourself.
+ Ignore it and hope it will go away.  
+ Go home, go to the gym, eat, sleep on it.
+ Other suggestions.  

Sound familiar?  Has this happened before?  

Of course it has.  Many, many times, to many, many people and projects.  You are not the first, and you will not be the last person this happens to.

__Q: What *can* you do?__
+ Get organized. 
+ Plan ahead. 
+ Prioritize.  

__A: Project Management__ 
Project management has tools to help you organize, understand, anticipate and react.  Even if it's not your primary job, it will be somebody's job in your organization. 
It can help you to understand how they think, and help everything work smoothly.  

There are lots of styles of project management.  
+ Waterfall 
+ Agile (popular these days)
Regardless of which style of project management you use, there are some common features.

### Essential Features of Project Management

##### 1. Definition
Q: What is a project?  

A: An activity with a definite goal within a specified time frame.  

Example Mission Statement: Put a man on the moon by the end of the decade.  

##### 2. Project phases
+ Start: Define the project.  Get backing of key stakeholders.  Obtain budget and resources.  
+ Middle: Many steps to do on most projects.  There may be multiple iterations (see Agile).  Ramp up resources in the middle, get stuff done.  
+ End: Product release!  May ramp down resources, or reallocate to other projects.  May need product support after release, maintenance, end-of-life planning (when replaced by another product).  

##### 3. Define stakeholders, roles.  
+ Stakeholders are anyone who has an interest in the project.  
    + Managers
    + Workers (engineers, sales, marketing, tech support)
    + Contractors, vendors (provide hardware, software resources, infrastructure)
    + Customers
+ Roles
    + Software developer
    + Product owner, scrum master (usually helps define the product, keep it on track)
    + Software testing
    + Managers, executives, administration, accountants
    + Customer representatives

##### 4. Resources, Schedule, Scope (project variables)
+ Resources: people, budget, software & hardware needed
+ Schedule: set time estimates, dependencies of different phases of project
+ Scope: what is included in each phase, and what is not
The *Iron Triangle.*  You can trade off project variables.  
Examples:
+ If schedule is cut, you can cut the scope, or add resources.  
+ If resources are cut, you can increase schedule to get same amount of work done.

##### 5. Work Breakdown Structure
+ Brainstorm ideas (usually in the beginning of project / phase)
+ Define user stories, what customers want.
+ Break into doable pieces, work items.  Level of detail depends what you need.
+ Define dependencies.  Item A must be before Items B and C, but B and C may be done in any order.
+ Rearrange work items, schedules.
+ Prioritize items.  Some items are required, have fixed schedule, dependencies, others are flexible.
+ Time estimates for each item, for writing software, testing software, writing documentation.
+ Are estimates accurate?  What is error range?
+ Tools: 
    + whiteboard
    + post-its
    + project software (e.g. Pivotal Tracker, Microsoft Project)
    + user stories
    + planning documents, design review
    + email, talk to each other, human communication
    + feature tracking, bug tracking (e.g. Bugzilla)
    + software source code tools: git, branching
    + get metrics
+ Try to find critical path, find Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  
+ Be aware any of these may change.

##### 6. Different ways to manage projects.
It depends on the organization.
+ Big companies, government, 1000's of workers.  
    + Break into smaller teams, who must communicate with each other.
    + Need organization.
    + Usually longer time frame. 
    + Example: Waterfall, lots of chained dependencies.
+ Small companies, startups.
    + Agile, iterative.
    + Small flexible teams.  
    + Several iterations to achieve viable product.
    + Example: Scrum
        + Monthly sprints (working product at end of each sprint).
        + Daily short standup meetings to resolve blocking issues.
        + Review feature backlog, burndown rate (buzzwords).

All of these need:
+ product definitions
+ testing
+ customer feedback
+ issue tracking, metrics

##### 7. Tips for good productive meetings.
+ What type of meeting is it?  Announcements?  Design review?  Status reports?
+ Mostly one person presenting?  Or each team member (encourage all to participate)?
+ Only invite those necessary (but make sure necessary stakeholders are represented).
+ Give everyone a chance to speak, for input.
+ Do not interrupt people.  Do not let others dominate the meeting.
+ Have a written agenda.  Clearly state goals. 
+ Set a limit of one hour or less (unless it's really extraordinary).  People get bored, tired, need a break if longer.
+ Only invite needed personnel.  Do not waste others' time.
+ Are decisions expected, or just a discussion?
+ Have action items.  Assign responsibilities to them, if possible.
+ Write meeting minutes.
+ Follow up email with decisions made.
Hopefully this will avoid repeat meetings on the same topic with no decisions made.

##### 8. Project end
+ Release to customers (or permanent beta, e.g. gmail).
+ Gather / monitor feedback.
+ Track unreleased features (for next sprint / release), bugs,  unresolved issues
+ Add fixes / patches as needed.
+ Communicate well to stakeholders.
+ Get revenue.
+ Plan for product end-of-life (if needed).
+ Review lessons learned, retrospective.


### Back to Basics

Summary.  
+ Clearly define project goals.
+ Make sure you have the resources to do it and stakeholder support.
+ Define resources, schedule, scope.
+ Set work items, time estimates, dependencies.
+ Prioritize.
+ Use software tracking, feature / bug tracking.
+ Build your dream.

These tools are here to help you.  Also to help managers understand what's going on.

If you like, take a class on Project Management, get practice.  Usually 8-10 weeks.  
You can even get certified as a PMP (Project Management Professional).

### Back to Original Question

Given all of these tools, how would you respond to a "crisis"?
+ Get organized.
+ Look at resources.
+ Look at schedule.
+ Talk to others, get ideas, input.
+ Cut scope, schedule where possible.
+ Give management options.  Let them decide.
+ Learn.

A wise (wo)man once said:
Good judgment comes from experience.
Experience comes from bad judgment.
Learn from your mistakes, (young grasshopper).
